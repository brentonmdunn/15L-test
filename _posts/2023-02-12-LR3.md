In this chapter, I take up dilemmas that today’s parents face in rearing young children. Throughout this book, we have touched on myriad forces that make contemporary parenting highly challenging. These include one-sided, contradictory messages in the parenting-advice literature; career pressures that impinge on parent involvement in children’s lives; abysmally weak American child-care services to assist employed parents in their child-rearing roles; cultural violence and excessive materialism permeating children’s worlds; schools with less than optimal conditions for children’s learning; and impediments to granting children with deﬁcits and disabilities social experiences that maximize their development. 
Throughout elementary school, girls get better grades in math—and other academic subjects—than do boys. At times, school-age boys outperform girls on math achievement tests,52 but boys’ advantage in math isn’t clearly evident until secondary school. A close look at children’s performance on speciﬁc test items reveals that both genders do equally well in basic math knowledge, and girls do better in computational skills. Boys’ advantage appears on tests of math reasoning, primarily on complex word problems and in geometry.53
The cause of boys’ late-appearing math advantage is a matter of controversy. Some experts believe the difference is rooted in boys’ superior ability to reason about spatial relations. Gender differences in spatial skills are present by elementary school and persist throughout life.54 Young people who are good at spatial reasoning are, indeed, better at solving complex math problems.55 One conjecture is that male (androgen) hormones may play some role in enhancing boys’ spatial skills. But evidence favoring this idea is inconsistent.56
Throughout the school years, girls attain higher scores on reading and writing achievement tests and account for a lower percentage of children referred for remedial reading instruction.65 Part of the reason for girls’ advantage in literacy development is that they undergo a faster rate of physical maturation, believed to promote slightly earlier development of the left hemisphere of the cerebral cortex, where language functions are housed for most people.66 In addition, many types of developmental problems are more common among boys, including speech and language disorders, reading disabilities, and inattention and hyperactivity. Boys’ and girls’ differing genetic makeups probably underlie these gender differences, which affect reading and writing performance.67

Outputs all of the lines that contains "throughout". The `-i` is useful because you don't know if "throughout" is capitalized (such as in the beginnning of the sentence) or not.


### Example 1b:

```bash
$ grep -i "stores" written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch1.txt 
```

```
In the late 1940s, Bond Stores, the largest men’s clothing chain at the time, created a sensation in New York City by offering a wide selection of suits with two pairs of pants instead of one, reintroducing a level of product choice not seen since before the war.1 When the line of hopeful buyers at its Times Square store stretched around the block, Bond had to impose a limit of two suits per customer. During World War II, the apparel and textile industries had been converted to supply field jackets, overcoats, and uniforms to the U.S. and Allied Forces. But in the years immediately following the war, returning soldiers, the end of rationing, and pent-up customer demand meant apparel was in short supply.
Fifty years later, it is hard to imagine a retailer—be it a high-end department store, mass merchandiser, or catalog service—limiting an individual customer’s clothing purchase. Retailers collect detailed point-of-sales information that reflects the real-time demand for goods by consumers. Through new computer systems, they share this information with suppliers who, in turn, can ship orders within days to automated distribution centers. The contemporary equivalent of Bond Stores now has a much better chance of avoiding stock-outs of popular items and the inventory gluts that lead to costly markdowns. By the same token, the overall risk associated with fickle consumers, numerous selling seasons, and segmented markets—along with fierce overseas competition—has currently made this a tough arena for American retailers and manufacturers.
The most surprising aspect of this story is that today’s U.S. apparel and textile industries—left for dead by business commentators and economic analysts in the 1980s—have begun to transform themselves, reaping new competitive advantages. Although Bond Stores’ customers were thrilled by a suit with two pairs of pants, contemporary customers want and expect a huge range of choices, and the consumer desire for limitless variety has kept the American apparel industry alive. In 1995, for instance, American consumers purchased 28.7 outerwear garments (all coats, jackets, shirts, dresses, blouses, sweaters, trousers, slacks, and shorts) per capita; in China the estimated number of such garments was only 2 per capita.2
Supply channels are not new, of course; for centuries, fabric-makers have sold their wares to those who cut and sew garments. But, until recently, most channels in the textile and apparel industries have been characterized by arm’s-length relationships among relatively autonomous firms. It is only since the mid-1980s that a number of market and technological changes have encouraged companies to enhance the links among different stages of production and distribution. Indeed, retailers like Wal-Mart Stores, Kmart Corporation, and Dillard’s Inc. have been the driving forces behind changes in manufacturing and logistics systems in a way that was unheard of in Bond Stores’ time. For instance, entrepreneur Sam Walton built a retail juggernaut that began with thirty-nine Wal-Mart stores in 1971 and grew to almost three thousand by 1996. He did so by insisting that suppliers implement information technologies for exchanging sales data, adopt standards for product labeling, and use modern methods of material handling that assured customers a variety of products at low prices.
When Bond Stores had customers lining up around the block to buy suits, “casual wear,” as we know it today, did not exist. Even in the 1960s, men wore suits, ties, and hats to the ballpark, and women were clothed in dresses and millinery. As recently as 1969, the dress code at Harvard required undergraduate men to wear a collar, necktie, and jacket in the dining halls; women had to wear a dress or a skirt and blouse. It wasn’t until the 1970s that these vestiges of formality gave way to blue jeans and T-shirts—the casual wear uniform. The 1980s ushered in yuppie brands, and in the 1990s history repeated itself as baby boomers’ children adopted the bedraggled grunge look. Many business firms have “casual days” for office attire. Now six out of ten U.S. employers now have casual days in their workplaces, all but a few establishing this practice during the 1990s. About seven out of ten organizations with dress-down days permit employees to wear polo shirts, jeans, and sneakers.4
Meanwhile, structural changes in the retail industry have influenced how and where clothing is sold. The growth of the highway system around central cities and the rapid expansion of suburbs created new opportunities for shopping centers, malls, and other outlets closer to a growing number of two wage-earner families. The metropolitan suburbs increased housing units in the 1950s through the 1980s far faster than the inner cities or the rural suburbs.8 Because inner cities retained a high proportion of lower income families, increased purchasing power for shelter, food, and clothing shifted to the suburbs. That means the large department stores traditionally based in cities, such as Macy’s or Marshall Field and Company—served by mass transportation and marketed through newspaper advertisements—suffered from the competition of mass distributors like Wal-Mart and specialty shops in new locations.
The manufacture of men’s shirts provides another illustration. Throughout much of the post-World War II era, the majority of men’s shirts sold in the United States were white dress shirts, primarily through department stores. Shirts with stripes, patterns, and uncommon colors constituted less than 30 percent of all dress shirts sold through the 1960s.20 In this environment, low fashion content and limited product variety made demand for individual shirts relatively predictable. Store buyers succeeded by striking deals with apparel manufacturers for large shipments of white shirts at the lowest possible price and with long delivery lead times. Unlike the women’s industry, where style has always mattered more, relatively large men’s apparel manufacturers such as Haggar; Hart, Schaffner, and Marx; Fruit of the Loom; Arrow Shirt Company; and Hathaway Shirt emerged, seeking to capture economies of scale.21
Note that these significant technological, market, and environmental changes largely originated outside the apparel industry itself. As we will make clear, changes that emerge in a market economy in one sphere often have unforeseen consequences in others. Bar codes, for instance, began with the food and grocery industry in the 1970s to lower the labor costs of cashier work and avoid delays to customers.24 With the commercialization of the laser, automated checkout became more than an industry vision. A committee of CEOs from grocery manufacturers, food chain stores, and other companies met in 1970 to develop a “universal product code” for scanning purposes: the first five digits stand for the manufacturer and the last five identify the item at the stockkeeping unit (SKU) level.25 All the digits are represented in the now-familiar sequence of light and dark bars of differing widths. By 1975, bar codes had begun to spread throughout food chain stores and grocery manufacturers. But almost another decade passed before the practice was adopted by apparel retailers and manufacturers.
Similar dynamics are cropping up in nonclothing areas as well. Grocery stores now stock a profusion of toothbrushes, Home Depot has shelves and shelves of different light bulbs, and Dell offers custom-configured personal computers. The growing presence of fashion-basic elements in myriad consumer products means that all retailers and suppliers may find new competitive opportunities using replenishment.
The information-integrated channel, with its emphasis on time and product perishability, is the basis for our cautiously optimistic—and unconventional—outlook. Even more important, the forces examined in this book provide a glimpse into processes reshaping a considerable portion of the economy. Consumers no longer line up for a special suit at a store like Bond Stores; they also expect an ever more “fashionable” array of cereal products, computers, and automobiles. As the next chapter shows, the changes now under way have their roots in new technologies, just as technical advances in transportation and communication shifted the industrial landscape at the end of the last century.

 Outputs all of the lines that contains "stores". The `-i` is useful because sometimes "stores" is capalized because it is used in a name and sometimes it is lowercase due to it being used as a regular noun reference.

## Command: `grep -c`

### Example 2a:

``` bash
$ grep -c "Bond Stores" written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch1.txt 
```

```
6
```


 Outputs the number of lines that contains "Bond Stores". The `-c` is useful if you want to know in how many lines "Bond Stores" is referenced without needing the exact location or context.

### Example 2b:

```bash
$ grep -c "Sydney:" written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Berk/ch2.txt
```

```
6
```


 Outputs the number of lines that contains "Sydney:". "Sydney:" is written on a new line whenever that character speaks. The `-c` is useful because it can be used to count how many times the character speaks.

## Command: `grep -h`

### Example 3a:
```bash
$ grep -h "Father:" written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Berk/ch2.txt
```

```
Father: Which piece might go down here? (Points to the bottom of the puzzle)
Father: Well, ﬁnd a piece that looks like this shape and matches this color. (Points again to the bottom of the puzzle)
Father: There you have it! Now try turning that piece just a little. (Gestures to show her)
Father: Now, Sydney, watch. Suppose I put this piece here. Will that work? (Places a blue piece next to a second blue piece, but the space is too small and the wrong shape)
Father: What should I do?
```


 Outputs the lines that contains "Father:". "Father:" is written on a new line whenever that character speaks. The `-h` is useful because it can show all of the lines of dialogue for that character.

### Example 3b:
```bash
$ grep -h "Period" written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Beijing-History.txt 
```

```
The Ming Period
The Qing Period
```


 Outputs the lines that contains "Period". In this context, "Period" is only used to refer to a dynasty. Using `-h`, you can identify the names of all of the dynasties.

## Command: `grep -l`
